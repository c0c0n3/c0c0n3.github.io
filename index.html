    <p class="intro">
      <em>c0c0n3</em> stands for co-cone which is what I call whatever looks like an
      upside down cone after snorting an epic amount of maths.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if snorting maths wasn't bad enough, I also have binge programming disorder.
      I desperately needed a username to remind me constantly of how badly maths and
      programming can mess up your brain, hoping one day I'd give up my addictions.
      What better than silly-sounding maths jargon then? "Cocone", honestly, say it
      loud! (Not in public though...)
      Also, why not go the whole hog and make it look like source code? For that, just
      replace vowels with numbers and—voilà!—you have <code>c0c0n3</code>.
    </p>
    <p class="pull-quote">
      Oh, the use of a Leet-looking username is totally accidental, <em>surely not</em>
      meant as a proclamation of a high level of skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are you likely to find here? Lots of <a href="http://ncatlab.org/">maths</a>
      and (mostly <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">functional</a>) programming as well
      as ways to use the maths hammer & chisel to craft <a href="https://patternsinfp.wordpress.com/">
      beautiful</a> programs. (Follow the links to see the sort of stuff I like and find
      beautiful; the plan is to start blogging about some of that stuff…)
      Did I mention I've got an addiction problem?

    <h2>About the Logo</h2>
    <p>
      So I had a username but no avatar to use for profile pictures. The horror!
      Fortunately after snorting a couple of decent sized lines of category theory,
      I had an idea: turn a diagram with a cocone into an avatar!
      Navigate through the slides below if you want to see what was buzzing in my
      skull...
    </p>
    <figure id="slide-1" class="slide">
      <img src="media/avatar-slides.svg#layer1" alt="Category Q"/>
      <figcaption>
        Commutative diagram of category Q with 6 arrows; 3 non-identity arrows and
        3 identities: i, j, k. (Using "arrows-only" definition of category.)
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure id="slide-2" class="slide">
      <img src="media/avatar-slides.svg#g10367" alt="Endo-functor F"/>
      <figcaption>
        Endo-functor F on Q maps arrows as noted on right and as suggested by colours,
        giving smiley diagram in Q. (Dots stand for identities.) 
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure id="slide-3" class="slide">
      <img src="media/avatar-slides.svg#g9044" alt="Natural transformation ζ"/>
      <figcaption>
        Natural transformation ζ from F to constant functor with fixed identity k;
        its components are: c<sub>0</sub> , c<sub>0</sub> , n<sub>3</sub> … a cocone
        of the smiley diagram!
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="slides-nav">
      <span>go to slide:</span>
      <a href="#slide-1" title="go to slide 1"><span>1</span>•</a>
      <a href="#slide-2" title="go to slide 2"><span>2</span>•</a>
      <a href="#slide-3" title="go to slide 3"><span>3</span>•</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
      In words, the basic idea was to get a cocone ζ of a diagram F that I could
      deform into a smiley and to have ζ's components add up to a sequence of symbols
      (c<sub>0</sub> c<sub>0</sub> n<sub>3</sub>) that would be a sort of stylish
      rendering of c0c0n3. (Yup, on top of my addictions I also have bad taste!)
      Once I had that, I deformed the whole thing into the shapes you see in my
      profile picture and then just added a touch of colour.
      See? There's a method to my madness!
