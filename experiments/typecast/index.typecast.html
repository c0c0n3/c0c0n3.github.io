      <em>c0c0n3</em> stands for co-cone which is what I call whatever looks like an
      upside down cone after snorting an epic amount of maths.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if snorting maths wasn't bad enough, I also have binge programming disorder.
      I desperately needed a username to remind me constantly of how badly maths and
      programming can mess up your brain, hoping one day I'd give up my addictions.
      What better than silly-sounding maths jargon then? "Cocone", honestly, say it
      loud! (Not in public though...)
      Also, why not make it look like source code? For that, just replace vowels with
      numbers and—voilà!—you have <code>c0c0n3</code>.
    </p>
    <p class="pull-quote"> <!-- TODO: use icon? -->
      Oh, the use of a Leet-looking username is totally accidental, <em>surely not</em>
      meant as a proclamation of a high level of skill. <!-- TODO: smiley icon -->
    </p>
    <p>
      What are you likely to find here? Lots of maths and (mostly functional) programming
      as well as how to use maths to craft beautiful programs. 
      Did I mention I've got an addiction problem?

    <h2>About the Logo</h2>
    <p>
      So I had a username but no avatar to use for profile pictures. The horror!
      Fortunately after snorting a couple of decent sized lines of category theory, I had
      an idea: turn a diagram with a cocone into an avatar!
      Below is the diagram I came up with.
    </p>
    <!-- TODO figure tag -->
    <p>
      Picturing the limiting cocone with its base and all components gives this other
      diagram below which I deformed into the shapes you see in my profile picture;
      then I just added some colour.
      See? There's a method to my madness!
